# üòª
# Demo time

```notes
Before I get into the content though, I'd like to make a quick and fun demo of an extension I built for this talk.
It's got lots of cats. Because cats are awesome~ 
It's called catify extension and it displays random cat gifs right on your browser window anytime you want
```

#  ü§î
# What is a browser extension?

```notes
Browser extensions are awesome not only because they can bring over cat gifs onto a browser window, but
they make our browsing experience better and more efficient by customizing them.

```notes
They are small apps built using web technologies like html, css, javascript.
They usually sit on the top-right hand side of your browser‚Äôs window.
They can use the same APIs the browser provides to the web. 
```

### Pocket

<ImageContainer 
    src='https://duaw26jehqd4r.cloudfront.net/items/3K1p1V1c1F392K2y3O08/Screen%20Recording%202018-10-21%20at%2002.28%20PM.gif'
    height='28rem'
    width='48rem'
/>

Saves any page

```notes
For example, using Pocket extension you can save online content to your pocket app to consume online or offline later
```
---
# ‚öôÔ∏è 
# Modify an existing feature 
# Create a new feature

```notes
They can modify the behavior of existing features or add new features to the browser. The feature could be something 
in the user interface or a functional feature that manifests itself when a certain action is performed. 
```
---
### Video Speed Controller

import { ImageContainer } from './components/ImageContainer'

<ImageContainer 
    src='images/video-speed-contoller.png'
    height='24rem'
    width='36rem'
/>

Allows you to control speed of a video with quick shortcuts

```notes
For example Video Speed Controller extension you can fast-forward videos with keyboard shortcuts
```
---
# ‚úèÔ∏è
# Modify the UI and page content

```notes
They can modify browser‚Äôs user interface by adding, removing, or modifying content. 
```
---
import { Image } from 'mdx-deck'

<Image src='images/momentum.png' />

```notes
Momentum would be a good example to that. It changes the design of your new tab window.
```
---
# üöÄ
# Add development tools

```notes
They can enhance the built-in browser developer tools.
```

# Extension Development

```notes
now that we have a better understanding of type of things that extensions can do, 
let's talk a bit about Extensions development. As I mentioned earlier,

they are created using web-based technologies‚ÄîHTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

You can also use one of the modern frameworks to build your extension as long as you use 
a module-bundler like webpack. 

Not only Extensions can take advantage of the web APIs, 
they also have access to their own set of JavaScript APIs which makes them very powerfull
```

    height='44rem'
    width='58rem'
/>

```notes
Every modern browser has their own extension API. The most popular one among all is Chrome's api which is also compatible with Firefox, 
Opera and Edge. Extensions written for Chrome will in most cases run in these browsers with just a few¬†changes. Firefox's api is also
compatible with Chrome. So if you want to develop your extension on Firefox but wanna run in Chrome. You can do that.

In the rest of my talk though, I will focus on Chrome's extension api.
```

# üèõ
# Chrome Extension Architecture

```notes
Before developing an extension, It's important to understand an extension's architecture 
which is composed of multiple components:
```
---
import { Appear } from 'mdx-deck'

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <h1>manifest.json üíì</h1>
    <h1>Popup UI üôãüèª‚Äç</h1>
    <h1>Background Script üß†</h1>
    <h1>Content Script üí™üèª</h1>
    <h1>Options Page ‚öôÔ∏è</h1>
  </Appear>
</ul>

```notes
manifest.json: This is the only file that must be present in every extension. It bootstraps the extension and provide basic metadata such as extension‚Äôs name, version¬†and the permissions it requires. It also provides pointers to other files in the extension. It's like the heart of the extension

Popup UI: The little window you see when clicking on the extension icon. It's the UI interface of the extension. It‚Äôs an html file with some css and optional js.

Background scripts: are long-running scripts that help you manage state and coordinate tasks across extension components. They are like the brain of the extension and all ‚Äúhard‚Äù business logic should go in here as much as possible.
They can use the standard DOM APIs, as well as the extension api. They can make network requests and can load content scripts into the web pages. They don't have direct acces to web pages but can communicate with content scripts using a message-passing API.

Content Scripts: are js files with optional css that are injected into selected pages. They read and modify the DOM of web pages the browser visits. They are like the hands of the extensions. Content scripts can communicate with their parent extension by exchanging¬†messages. 
Unlike background scripts content scripts have limited access to Chrome's api.

Options page¬†enables customization of the extension. It can be used to enable features and allow users to choose what functionality is relevant to their needs.
```
---
### manifest.json
```
{
    "name": "Catify Extension",
    "description": "Random cat gifs on your browser",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "manifest_version": 2,
    "browser_action": {
        "default_popup": "index.html"
    },
    "icons": { "128": "cat-icon.png" },
    "permissions": ["tabs", "https://api.giphy.com/*"],
    "content_scripts": [{
        "matches": ["<all_urls>"],
        "js": [ "script_bundle.js"]
    }],
    "web_accessible_resources": ["assets/*"]
}
```

```notes
here is a little code snippet that lays out the structure of a manifest file. It's from the catify extension I showed 
you earlier in the talk. You can see extension's metadata as well as its icon being defined in here. Browser action field 
defines the popup ui. Similar to popup ui the Content script is being initiated in here as well. Content script points to
a bundled js file and includes urls that it is allowed to inject the script to. In this case, it can get injected to all the webpages.
If extension had a background script you would also include it in this file under "background" key. 
web_accessible_resources include things like other images in your extension and it makes the content accessible to web pages and content scripts.
```

# üíå
# Message Passing

```notes
Message passing is an important concept in the browser extension world
```
---
### Communication Between Pages

<br/>

<ImageContainer
    src='images/message-passing.png'
    height='32rem'
    width='50rem'
/>

```notes
Communication between extension's components is done by sending messages. Especially, Since content scripts
run in the context of a web page and not the extension, they often need some way of communicating with the rest of the extension. 

In message passing mechanism, Either side can listen for messages, and respond on the same channel. 

There is an API for one-time requests and as well as one that allows you to have long-lived connections for exchanging multiple messages.

It is also possible to send a message to another extension if you know its ID, which is referred as the cross-extension messaging.

I'd like to show you an example implementation of message passing from the catify extension.
```
---
### popup.js

```
chrome.tabs.query({
        active: true,
        currentWindow: true
    }, (tabs) => {
        chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tabs[0].id, {
                action: 'getApiData',
                message: request
            }, (response) => {
                console.log('Response received');
            });
    });
```

```notes
This code snippet shows sending a request from extension's popup to its content script. The request is an object
containing arbitrarely defined fields, and information assigned to them.
Here I have included a string that identifies my request as well as the data that I get from the giphy api

And the api gives you a callback that gets fired when a response from the other side is received.
```
---
### content-script.js
```
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((request, sender, sendResponse) => {
        const result = processRequest(request);

        if (!result) { return false; // no response }

        result.then((value) => {
            sendResponse({response: value});
        }, (error) => {
            sendResponse({ error: error.toString() });
        });

        return true; // signal that it will respond asyncronously
    });
```

```notes
On the receiving end, there is an event listener to handle the message. In the case of catify extension,
The data I receive in the handler is the gif url. Content script then injects the url onto the current page.

You can also send a response back to the sender. According to docs the onMessage 
event handler needs to return true if we want to respond asyncronously.

# Debugging

```notes
you can locally run and debug your extensions without having to go through the publishing process.
```

#### chrome://extensions -> Developer mode on -> Load unpacked -> üéâ

```notes
To run your extension locally, you need to go to the extensions page, turn on the developer mode if it's not 
already turned on and load your extension folder using the load unpacked button on the top left side of the page.

You can see a preview of your extension once it is loaded. You should come back to this page refresh your extension
every time you make a change in your code

#### üîç Popup

```notes
Debugging extensions can be a bit tricky as its components lives in different contexes.

Content scripts use the current browser windows‚Äô Developer Tools.

To debug the pop UI you simply need to right click on the ui and choose inspect.

```notes
If your extension has a background script, its dev tools page can be accessed from your extensions page.
